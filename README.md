## 🧰 Tech Stack:

- React
- React Router Dom v6
- JavaScript

## 🛠️ Techniques:

- **`React Router Dom Components`**:
  - **_NavLink_**: Is used for navigation between pages.
  - **_Outlet_**: Is a component provided by React Router that serves as a placeholder for child routes within a parent route.
- **`React Router Dom Hooks`**:

  - **_useLoaderData_**: Is a hook that helps to fetch the data for the component before it renders. It improves performance and prevents empty states.

  **`Note`**: This hook can be used only in the element that's assigned to a route AND in all components that might be used inside that element but not on a higher level route.
